[{"categories":null,"contents":"I wanted to work on projects that would benefit society and found Google Summer of Code (GSoC) to be the perfect opportunity. I worked with Free UK Genealogy, an organization that aims at the transcription of family data and explored Named Entity Recognition (NER) more deeply. I created an end-to-end framework that extracts text from wills, using OCR, and seeds them into a database with named entities. A big constraint in the project was a lack of adequate training samples to build an accurate NER model. To solve this, I used a bi-LSTM-CRF architecture that uses a small training set and unlabelled corpora. To train the NER system, I made use of SpaCy’s language model. For NER, the paper “Neural architectures for named entity recognition” formed the basis of my NER model at Google Summer of Code. The system developed through GSoC has enabled the organization to extract structured data from scanned documents and build a new database for its users. The hybrid tagging structure was very helpful for labeling overlapping entity sets present in the data. The application developed through GSoC has enabled the organization to retrieve structured data from wills from 18th century England and launch a new database.

Through our research, we have been able to build a system that can generate questions and answer pairs on images. It consists of two separate modules - Visual Question Generation (VQG) which generates questions based on the image, and a Visual Question Answering (VQA) module that produces a befitting answer that the VQG module generates. Through our approach, we not only generate questions but evaluate the questions generated by using a question answering system. Moreover, with our methodology, we can generate question-answer pairs as well as improve the performance of VQA models. It eliminates the need for human intervention in dataset annotation and also finds applications in the field of the educational sector, where the requirement of human input for textual questions has been essential till now. Using our system, we aim to provide an interactive interface which helps the learning process among young children.

Demand for clean water in India is very high, especially for agriculture and consumption. One way to cater to these needs is through rainwater harvesting. Through this paper, we propose a framework that optimizes the site selection for reservoirs by intersecting various data points. Our framework uses a three-step approach to combine stream networks, digital elevation, and soil quality to produce the most viable reservoir sites. Our framework is easy to implement and highly scalable. For the purpose of this paper and a proof of concept, we restrict our focus to the arid Beed district in the state of Maharashtra, India. Our approach provides consistent results that are corroborated by the manual inferences that can be drawn from the data under consideration.\nWe create a simulation model that uses weather data and GIS data to formulate rainwater collection to optimize rainwater harvesting. My team developed a framework to optimize rainwater harvesting by finding viable reservoir locations using hydrological data, digital elevation maps and soil information using GIS software. Our project received a research grant from the University of Mumbai.\n","permalink":"https://shahsaumya.github.io/publications/gis/","tags":["Geoinformatics System","ArcGIS","ISRO Mosdac","SoilGrids","Bhuvan Topological Data","HydroSHEDS","Decision Support Systems"],"title":"Optimization of Rainwater Harvesting Sites using GIS"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In recent years, we have witnessed a significant progress in various fields of AI, such as computer vision, as well as language understanding. These progress motivated researchers to address a more challenging problem: question answering and question generation on visual data. This problem combines both image understanding as well as language understanding. Essentially, this task is defined as follows: an image along with a question about that image is the input to the AI system, and the intelligent system is supposed to output a correct answer to the question with respect the input image. However, taking a step beyond that, we through this project, aim to create a system which on taking an image as input generates a question-answer pair and when the user submits the answer, verification of the answer takes place. Our solution thus involves the usage of both the Visual Question Generation (VQG) and VQA model in a sequential manner. The VQG module generates reasonable questions given an image whereas, the VQA module generates natural answers given a question and an image. On the basis of the image, the VQG and VQA module will be used to get the correct question and then the answer.\nThe proposed solution will aim towards bridging the gap and assimilating verification of answers on the existing question answer generation platforms. The most immediate application is as an automatic dataset annotation tool. We can reduce the need for human intervention for dataset annotation. With an increasing need for varied datasets for Deep Learning, such applications can help reduce the need for human labour. Further, the solution will benefit the educational sector, as well as help, improve existing authentication using captcha. In the educational sector, children can use such an application to learn to answer basic questions from images. While these same images can be used as an extra step in authentication to increase the security of the project.
